  \item[46.]
    Compute the following binomial probabilities directly from the formula for $b(x; n, p)$:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[a.]
        $b(3; 8, .35)$
        \begin{align*}
          b(3; 8, .35) &= \bp{3}{8}{.35} \\
          &\approx 56 \times .042875 \times .1160290625 \\
          &\approx .2785857790625
        \end{align*}
      \item[b.]
        $b(5; 8, .6)$
        \begin{align*}
          b(5; 8, .6) &= \bp{5}{8}{.6}  \\
          &= 56 \times .07776 \times 0.064 \\
          &= .27869184
        \end{align*}
      \item[c.]
        $P(3 \le X \le 5)$ when $n = 7$ and $p = .6$
        \begin{align*}
          P(3 \le X \le 5) &= \sum_{y = 3}^5 b(y; 7; .6) \\
          &= \sum_{y = 3}^5 \bp{y}{7}{.6}  \\
          &= \begin{aligned}[t]
              &\bp{3}{7}{.6} + \bp{4}{7}{.6}  \\
            + &\bp{5}{7}{.6}
          \end{aligned} \\
          &= .193536 + .290304 + .2612736 \\
          &= .7451136
        \end{align*}
      \item[d.]
        $P(1 \le X)$ when $n = 9$ and $p = .1$
        \begin{align*}
          P(1 \le X) &= 1 - P(X = 0) \\
          &= 1 - b(0; 9; .1) \\
          &= 1 - \bp{0}{9}{.1} \\
          &\approx 1 - 0.38742 \\
          &\approx 0.61258
        \end{align*}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item[48.]
    NBC News reported on May 2, 2013, that 1 in 20 children in the United States have a food allergy of some sort. Consider selecting a random sample of 25 children and let $X$ be the number in the sample who have a food allergy. Then $X \sim$ Bin$(25, .05)$.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[a.]
        Determine both $P(X \le 3)$ and $P(X < 3)$.
        \begin{align*}
          P(X < 3) &= \sum_{y = 0}^3 b(y; 25; .05) \\
          &= \sum_{y = 0}^2 \bp{y}{25}{.05} \\
          &= \begin{aligned}[t]
              &\bp{0}{25}{.05} + \bp{1}{25}{.05} \\
            + &\bp{2}{25}{.05}
          \end{aligned} \\
          &\approx .27739 + .364986 + .230518 \\
          &\approx .872894 \\
          \\
          P(X \le 3) &= P(X < 3) + b(3; 25; .05) \\
          &\approx .872894 + \bp{3}{25}{.05} \\
          &\approx .872894 + .0930159 \\
          &\approx .9659099
        \end{align*}
      \item[b.]
        Determine $P(X \ge 4)$.
        \begin{align*}
          P(X \ge 4) &= 1 - P(X \le 3) \\
          &\approx 1 - .9659099 \\
          &\approx .0340901
        \end{align*}
      \item[c.]
        Determine $P(1 \le X \le 3)$.
        \begin{align*}
          P(1 \le X \le 3) &= P(X \le 3) - P(X = 0) \\
          &\approx .9659099 - .27739 \\
          &\approx .6885199
        \end{align*}
      \item[d.]
        What are $E(X)$ and $\sigma_x$?
        \begin{align*}
          E(X) &= np = 25 \times .05 = 1.25 \\
          \sigma_x &= \sqrt{np(1 - p)} = \sqrt{1.25(1 - .05)} = \sqrt{1.1875} \approx 1.08972
        \end{align*}
      \item[e.]
        In a sample of 50 children, what is the probability that none has a food allergy?
        \begin{align*}
          P(X = 0) &= b(0; 50; .05) \\\
          &= \bp{0}{50}{.05} \\
          &\approx 1 \times 1 \times .076945 \\
          &\approx .076945
        \end{align*}
    \end{enumerate}
  \item[50.]
    A particular telephone number is used to receive both voice calls and fax messages. Suppose that 25\% of the incoming calls involve fax messages, and consider a sample of 25 incoming calls. What is the probability that
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[a.]
        At most 6 of the calls involve a fax message?
        \begin{align*}
          P(X \le 6) &= \sum_{y = 0}^6 b(y; 25; .25) \\
          &= \sum_{y = 0}^6 \bp{y}{25}{.25} \\
          &= \begin{aligned}[t]
              &\bp{0}{25}{.25} + \bp{1}{25}{.25} \\
            + &\bp{2}{25}{.25} + \bp{3}{25}{.25} \\
            + &\bp{4}{25}{.25} + \bp{5}{25}{.25} \\
            + &\bp{6}{25}{.25}
          \end{aligned} \\
          &\approx \begin{aligned}[t]
              &.000753 + .006271 + .025085 + .064106 \\
            + &.117527 + .164538 + .182820
          \end{aligned} \\
          &\approx .561098
        \end{align*}
      \item[b.]
        Exactly 6 of the calls involve a fax message?
        \begin{align*}
          P(X = 6) &= b(6; 25; .25) \\
          &= \bp{6}{25}{.25} \\
          &\approx .182820
        \end{align*}
      \item[c.]
        At least 6 of the calls involve a fax message?
        \begin{align*}
          P(X \ge 6) &= 1 - P(x < 6) \\
          &= 1 - P(x \le 6) + P(X = 6) \\
          &\approx 1 - .561098 + .182820 \\
          &\approx .621722
        \end{align*}
      \item[d.]
        More than 6 of the calls involve a fax message?
        \begin{align*}
          P(X > 6) &= 1 - P(x \le 6) \\
          &\approx 1 - .561098 \\
          &\approx  .438902
        \end{align*}

    A particular type of tennis racket comes in a midsize version and an oversize version. Sixty percent of all customers at a certain store want the oversize version.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[a.]
        Among ten randomly selected customers who want this type of racket, what is the probability that at least six want the oversize version?
      \item[b.]
        Among ten randomly selected customers, what is the probability that the number who want the oversize version is within 1 standard deviation of the mean value?
      \item[c.]
        The store currently has seven rackets of each version. What is the probability that all of the next ten cus- tomers who want this racket can get the version they want from current stock?
    \end{enumerate}
  \item[56.]
    The College Board reports that 2\% of the 2 million high school students who take the SAT each year receive special accommodations because of documented disabilities (\textit{Los Angeles Times}, July 16, 2002). Consider a random sample of 25 students who have recently taken the test.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[a.]
        What is the probability that exactly 1 received a special accommodation?
      \item[b.]
        What is the probability that at least 1 received a special accommodation?
      \item[c.]
        What is the probability that at least 2 received a special accommodation?
      \item[d.]
        What is the probability that the number among the 25 who received a special accommodation is within 2 standard deviations of the number you would expect to be accommodated?
      \item[e.]
        Suppose that a student who does not receive a special accommodation is allowed 3 hours for the exam, whereas an accommodated student is allowed 4.5 hours. What would you expect the average time allowed the 25 selected students to be?
