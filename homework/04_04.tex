\begin{enumerate}
  \item[59.]
    Let $X =$ the time between two successive arrivals at the drive-up window of a local bank. If $X$ has an exponential distribution with $\lambda = 1$ (which is identical to a standard gamma distribution with $\alpha = 1$), compute the following:
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[a.]
        The expected time between two successive arrivals
      \item[b.]
        The standard deviation of the time between successive arrivals
      \item[c.]
        $P(X \le 4)$
      \item[d.]
        $P(2 \le X \le 5)$
    \end{enumerate}
  \item[60.]
    Let $X$ denote the distance (m) that an animal moves from its birth site to the first territorial vacancy it encounters. Suppose that for banner-tailed kangaroo rats, $X$ has an exponential distribution with parameter $\lambda = .01386$ (as suggested in the article ``Competition and Dispersal from Multiple Nests,'' \textit{Ecology}, 1997: 873â€“883).
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[a.]
        What is the probability that the distance is at most 100 m? At most 200 m? Between 100 and 200 m?
      \item[b.]
        What is the probability that distance exceeds the mean distance by more than 2 standard deviations?
      \item[c.]
        What is the value of the median distance?
    \end{enumerate}
  \item[65.]
    Let $X$ denote the data transfer time (ms) in a grid computing system (the time required for data transfer between a ``worker'' computer and a ``master'' computer. Suppose that $X$ has a gamma distribution with mean value 37.5 ms and standard deviation 21.6 (suggested by the article ``Computation Time of Grid Computing with Data Transfer Times that Follow a Gamma Distribution,'' \textit{Proceedings of the First International Conference on Semantics, Knowledge, and Grid}, 2005).
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[a.]
        What are the values of $\alpha$ and $\beta$?
      \item[b.]
        What is the probability that data transfer time exceeds 50 ms?
      \item[c.]
        What is the probability that data transfer time is between 50 and 75 ms?
    \end{enumerate}
  \item[67.]
    Suppose that when a transistor of a certain type is subjected to an accelerated life test, the lifetime $X$ (in weeks) has a gamma distribution with mean 24 weeks and standard deviation 12 weeks.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[a.]
        What is the probability that a transistor will last between 12 and 24 weeks?
      \item[b.]
        What is the probability that a transistor will last at most 24 weeks? Is the median of the lifetime distribution less than 24? Why or why not?
      \item[c.]
        What is the 99th percentile of the lifetime distribution?
      \item[d.]
        Suppose the test will actually be terminated after $t$ weeks. What value of $t$ is such that only .5\% of all transistors would still be operating at termination?
    \end{enumerate}
