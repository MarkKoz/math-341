    A concrete beam may fail either by shear ($S$) or flexure ($F$). Suppose that three failed beams are randomly selected and the type of failure is determined for each one. Let $X =$ the number of beams among the three selected that failed by shear. List each outcome in the sample space along with the associated value of $X$.

    Some parts of California are particularly earthquake-prone. Suppose that in one metropolitan area, 25\% of all homeowners are insured against earthquake damage. Four homeowners are to be selected at random; let $X$ denote the number among the four who have earthquake insurance.
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[a.]
        Find the probability distribution of X. [\textit{Hint:} Let $S$ denote a homeowner who has insurance and $F$ one who does not. Then one possible outcome is $SFSS$, with probability (.25)(.75)(.25)(.25) and associated $X$ value 3. There are 15 other outcomes.]

  \item[18.]
    Two fair six-sided dice are tossed independently. Let $M =$ the maximum of the two tosses (so $M(1,5) = 5$, $M(3,3) = 3$, etc.).
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[a.]
        What is the pmf of $M$? [\textit{Hint:} First determine $p(1)$, then $p(2)$, and so on.]
        \\ \\
        Let $D_i =$ the result of tossing a fair six-sided die $i$. Thus, for any result $d$, $P(D_i = d) = \frac{1}{6}$. For each value $m$ of $M$, the corresponding outcomes are those in which one die lands on $m$ and the other on some value $\le m$. The pmf can be expressed as
        \begin{align*}
          p(m) = P((D_1 = m \cap D_2 \le m) \cup (D_2 = m \cap D_1 \le m))
        \end{align*}
        First, determine the probability of the left side of the union.
        \begin{align*}
          P(D_1 = m \cap D_2 \le m) &= P(D_1 = m) \cdot P(D_2 \le m) \\
          &= \frac{1}{6} P(\bigcup_{k=1}^m D_2 = k) \\
          &= \frac{1}{6} \sum_{k=1}^m \frac{1}{6} \\
          &= \frac{1}{6} \cdot \frac{m}{6} \\
          &= \frac{m}{36}
        \end{align*}
        The above is also true for $P(D_2 = m \cap D_1 \le m))$ since the dice are the same and independent of each other. Thus,
        \begin{align*}
          p(m) &= P((D_1 = m \cap D_2 \le m) \cup (D_2 = m \cap D_1 \le m)) \\
          &= \begin{aligned}[t]
            &P(D_1 = m \cap D_2 \le m) + P(D_2 = m \cap D_1 \le m) \\
            - &P((D_1 = m \cap D_2 \le m) \cap (D_2 = m \cap D_1 \le m))
          \end{aligned} \\
          &= \frac{m}{36} + \frac{m}{36} - \frac{1}{36} \\
          &= \frac{2m - 1}{36}
        \end{align*}
        Note their intersection only has one outcome, which is when both dice land on $m$. Thus, its probability is $\frac{1}{36}$ and this can be seen being subtracted above.
      \item[b.]
        Determine the cdf of $M$ and graph it.
        \begin{align*}
          F(m) &= \sum_{n \le m} p(n) \\
          &= \sum_{n = 1}^m \frac{2n - 1}{36} \\
          &= \frac{1}{36} \sum_{n = 1}^m 2n - 1 \\
          &= \frac{1}{36} (2\sum_{n = 1}^m n - \sum_{n = 1}^m 1) \\
          &= \frac{1}{36} (\cancel{2} \times \frac{m(m + 1)}{\cancel{2}} - m) \\
          &= \frac{1}{36} (m(m + 1) - m) \\
          &= \frac{1}{36} (m^2 + \cancel{m} - \cancel{m}) \\
          &= \frac{m^2}{36}
        \end{align*}
