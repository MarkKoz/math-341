    Let $X$ denote the amount of time a book on two-hour reserve is actually checked out, and suppose the cdf is
    \begin{align*}
      F(x) = \begin{cases}
        0             & x < 0 \\
        \frac{x^2}{4} & 0 \le x < 2 \\
        1             & 2 \le x

    The cdf for $X$ (= measurement error) of Exercise 3 is
    \begin{align*}

    Example 4.5 introduced the concept of time headway in traffic flow and proposed a particular distribution for $X =$ the headway between two randomly selected consecutive cars (sec). Suppose that in a different traffic environment, the distribution of time headway has the form
    \begin{align*}
      f(x) = \begin{cases}
        \frac{k}{x^4} & x > 1 \\
        0             & x \le 1
      \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[a.]
        Determine the value of $k$ for which $f(x)$ is a legitimate pdf.
      \item[b.]
        Obtain the cumulative distribution function.
      \item[c.]
        Use the cdf from (b) to determine the probability that headway exceeds 2 sec and also the probability that headway is between 2 and 3 sec.
      \item[d.]
        Obtain the mean value of headway and the standard deviation of headway.
      \item[e.]
        What is the probability that headway is within 1 standard deviation of the mean value?
    \end{enumerate}

    Let $X$ denote the amount of space occupied by an article placed in a 1-ft$^3$ packing container. The pdf of $X$ is
    \begin{align*}
      f(x) = \begin{cases}
        90x^8(1 - x) & 0 < x < 1 \\
        0            & \text{otherwise}
      \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
    \begin{enumerate}
      \item[a.]
        Graph the pdf. Then obtain the cdf of $X$ and graph it.
      \item[b.]
        What is $P(X \le .5)$ [i.e., $F(.5)$]?
      \item[c.]
        Using the cdf from (a), what is $P(.25 < X \le .5)$? What is $P(.25 \le X \le .5)$?

        What is the 75th percentile of the distribution?
      \item[e.]
        Compute $E(X)$ and $\sigma_X$.
      \item[f.]
        What is the probability that $X$ is more than 1 standard deviation from its mean value?

    An ecologist wishes to mark off a circular sampling region having radius 10 m. However, the radius of the resulting region is actually a random variable $R$ with pdf
    \begin{align*}
      f(r) = \begin{cases}
        \frac{3}{4}[1 - (10 - r)^2] & 9 \le r \le 11 \\
        0                           & \text{otherwise}
      \end{cases}
    \end{align*}
    What is the expected area of the resulting circular region?
